                    Hi! My name is Benjamin Olsen, a full time teacher and native of snowy
                    Wisconsin. In my spare time I enjoy wrestling bears, watching the
                    Packers face the bears, and drinking bear I mean "beer." I graduated
                    with an education and Spanish degree in 2017, and have been teaching
                    high school Spanish ever since. I most recently moved to Washington
                    this past June and have enjoyed my time here, even through the rainy
                    weather. My friends and I have had opportunities to explore Mt.
                    Rainier, downtown Seattle, and the surrounding area night life. There
                    is a lot more to see, mainly restaurants, that I want to see and am
                    excited to make this new place my home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not have past experience coding but do have many friends and
                    colleagues who have gotten into the profession. One close friend even
                    took a similar boot camp and is now coding a website with his father.
                    My hope is that this class will be able to open new career paths and
                    strengthen my skills as a learner and professional.
                </p>
