# Bootstrap---HW---2

This portfolio project is similar to my first Homework 1 project, but is focused more on using Bootstrap.css and making content responsive to multiple media outlets. All three pages share minimal personal CSS, but are based around HTML and Bootstrap coding. While the main content of each page remains the same, additional features were added such as a collapsing Navbar and functional email input.

## Motivation
I created this project as a way to look back on my progress from Homework 1, and to see the benefits of making responsive page media queries. 

## Features
Homework 2 features beginner-level HTML and CSS but focuses on incorporating engaging elements and templates from Bootstrap's website. Fluid images, a sticky footer, and a collapsable Navbar are some of the responsive components featured on this assignment.
